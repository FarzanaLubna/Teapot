a. Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, let us know who you talked to and what sort of help you gave or received.

Ans: I did not collaborate & rely on anyone in my class but sometimes I have discussed with my classmates. I have followed the class lectures Google and YouTube to learn some extra more things from that.

b. Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for completing your assignment? Please provide a list.

Ans: Yes, Websites that helped me a lot to complete my assignment such as Stake Overflow, Geeks for Geeks etc in color changing, light position changing & the rotation part. 

c. Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This is very important, as we’re much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what’s going on.

Ans: Yes, I found a problem that the light source do not rotate fully over 360 degrees. It can rotate over 180 degrees but as it works as per requirements I did not able to fix this issues. But I tried to implement.  

d. Did you do any extra work? If so, let us know how to use the additional features. If there was a substantial amount of work involved, describe what and how you did it.

Ans: No, I don’t do any extra works.

e. Got any comments about this assignment that you’d like to share? Was it too long? Too hard? were the requirements unclear? Did you have fun, or did you hate it? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of your time?

Ans: The assignment was not too long or too hard. The requirments were clear. And yes, it gives fun after completing fully  when I show on my screen and obviously I have learned & cleared much more things at OpenGL code & funtions when I searched for.
And I think anyeone will be able to do it with their own basic knowledge & understanding of coding at OpenGL. Indeed, I can’t say I didn’t enjoy the task obviously it was enjoyable.
